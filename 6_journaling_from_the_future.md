# Journaling from the Future
Morning guys!
<br>
<br>
Recently I've been practicing the Morning Pages journaling technique. The goal of this strategy is to pour out a conscious stream of raw ideas, opinions, and everything in between onto three pages.

Unlike standard Journals, Morning Pages are an act of pure catharsis that streams thought through your fingers at the speed of light.

<br>
For me, it's meditative.

I believe that these pages of thoughts can teach you a lot about yourself, especially with the aid of Natural Language Processing.

The following are Natural Language Processing tools that should unlock insightful potential from your Morning Page:

- The classic text sentiment detector.
- A topic tagger/text summarizer.
  - Understanding the topics of your daydreams may reveal influences on your thoughts.
- Analysis of the kinds of words you chose for expression.
- A logical fallacy detector.
- Statistics on names discussed, questions posed, and the frequency of different concepts mentioned.

In my opinion, Morning Pages is the perfect medium for personal insights because modern ML text models work best with longer pieces of writing,

When combined with other sources of biometric data, I believe that patterns in your mindset will surface and thread a path to the splendour of personal growth.

I hope you checkpoint your life in writing this week!
