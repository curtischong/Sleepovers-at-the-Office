# Chrome Extensions for Messaging Apps
Morning guys!

I think that tech hasn't given communication apps a fair shot. Chatbots have failed, and Messenger still feels like SMS.


I believe that the next generation of chat apps should have Chrome extension-like applications to improve your conversation. For example:

- An extension that recommends witty jokes to follow through in conversation.
- A bot that spices up a conversation with the perfect talking points.
  - Ex: Suggesting thoughtful follow-up questions.
- An extension that suggests witty colloquialisms to make your conversations more engaging.
  - It'll introduce literary flare into your writing.

What's missing is an on-screen teacher that helps you become a better communicator in general:

- That makes you more authentic.
- That makes you more engaging.
- That makes you more thoughtful.
- That makes you more conscious.

I hope that these extensions will form online habits that will translate into practices in-person.


In brief, chat apps should help us become better people.


Believing in this textual panacea is folly in itself. But to some degree, I think that it'd be pretty cool.


If I've won you over on the potential of chat extensions, check out my open-sourced project: Messenger Assistant ([github.com/curtischong/Messenger-Assistant](https://github.com/curtischong/Messenger-Assistant)) to save you some work.
