# A Search Engine for Story Ideas

<p style="max-width: 600px;">
Authors can take years to publish a novel.
<br>
<br>
In comparison, musicians can finish a song a day. I think their creative process is sped up because they record flashes of inspiration as .mp3 files on their phones. Later they'll go through their recordings and crown a new song with these snippets from their collection.
<br>
<br>
Can authors record ideas the same way musicians record snippets of songs to help them write novels faster? What if authors can semantically search for long-lost scenes drafted up in vivid memory dreamt up from 2008?
<br>
A tool that can search for scenes riddled with "deceptive betrayal" can help overcome the dreaded writer's block or even sparkle plot synergies never considered.
<br>
<br>
Yes, authors may end up with MORE fragmented ideas if they mash a dozen ideas into a collage. But I think that a brilliant conductor will know when to give their picturesque snippets a solo.
<br>
<br>
I hope you have great reads this week!
