# How to Accurately Rank Chess Players
Morning guys!
<br>
<br>
Recently I've been captivated with chess and the Elo system that ranks a player's skill.

Although Elo is widely used to evaluate players, it does have shortcomings. Here are a few:

- Elo only converges to your actual rating after many games.
- The metric does not factor in skill degradation when you stop playing.
  - Or a home advantage.
- Elo is a relative metric. It only compares the relative skill of people within a group.
  - Ex: You can have a high Elo 2800 if you only play against a group of beginners.
  - Unfortunately, this score will be dreadfully inaccurate when you face 2800 players on a professional website.

I've been troubled with the last shortcoming. How can we determine someone's skill if their rating is always relative to who they play?

Can we come up with a score that reflects your real ability?

I think that players should play against computers because the skill of a machine is constant. If you can consistently beat a level 6 CPU, then you are at least level 6.

Surprisingly, we are at a time where computers can beat the best competitors in any game. This means that we can use them as opponents of definite skill to catalogue a player's strength.

This week I challenge you to develop a formula that can accurately identify one's ability in a game. I'll be delighted if your evaluation technique considers computer opponents.

I wish you the best of luck. Tackle this week with your A-game.
