# A Tool That Helps You Write Better

Morning all!

A lot of us are bad writers, myself included. And the main advice you hear is to read and write more. I guess that's probably true, but it doesn't feel true.

Because I don't care about learning how to write when I'm reading, I care about reading my book!

This seems like bad advice.

Instead of separating "reading sessions" from "writing sessions", we should be reading and writing at the same time to become better writers. After all, you won't remember what made Sapiens a great read when it's your turn to write.

So I've been working on a web app to help myself write better by combining the reading and writing process.

With each sentence I draft, my app will show me snippets of similar sentences online. After comparing my sentence with each snippet, I would incorporate the writing style that I like most in my draft.

Think of it as a thesaurus for writing styles.

This solution takes more effort to use than a spell checker. However, I believe that the effort spent actively understanding somebody else's writing expedites the learning process and beats the traditional "read and write mantra".

I'm still working out the bugs, but I'll let you know when it's finished.

I hope you read something new this week!
