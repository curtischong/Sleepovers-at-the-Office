# Decoration Should Present Information

Morning guys!
<br>
<br>
I have an album in Google Photos titled: "Things I Want in a House".
<br>
Here are a few images from my collection:
- A set of LED strips to show CPU and RAM usage on my server.
  - More LEDs will glow as more resources are used.
- A series of seven-segment displays.
  - I'll use them to show today's global CO2 emissions.

I believe that the decoration in your home should remind you of the things that you value. For you, that may be the number of minutes you've spent calling a friend this week, or if you're Bill Gates, the number of Polio vaccines delivered today.
<br>
<br>
I often find myself forgetting about the causes I once promised to help. Perhaps a statistic on the number of dead bees would be emotional for me.
<br>
<br>
My hope is that information as decoration will keep causes you care about within sight.
<br>
<br>
If you see these numbers daily, then perhaps one day, you'll connect dots and reveal a constellation that nobody has ever considered. You'll uncover a puzzle piece that builds towards a solution.
<br>
<br>
Without these reminders, your night sky may be too dim to find dots to connect.
<br>
<br>
I hope you'll remember a cause you care about this week, even if it's for a fleeting moment.
<br>
