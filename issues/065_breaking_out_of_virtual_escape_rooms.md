# Breaking out of Virtual Escape Rooms

###### First posted on August 9, 2021

I went to a virtual escape room at my last co-op. A virtual escape room is the same as an actual escape room except that there is only one person in the escape room, a staff member with a GoPro on their head. This camera is connected to a group zoom call to show us the escape room.

To solve the puzzles, we ask the staff member to try different actions such as looking for keys in pockets, entering passcodes into combination locks, and opening doors. We could also see a 360-degree view of the room on a separate website. And every item that we find is also accessible for inspection on that website.

Other than that, it's just like a typical escape room because you solve the puzzles given the resources inside the room. It was a refreshing experience, but I anticipated seeing puzzles that required internet assistance to solve.

What if there were puzzles in the room that required us to:

- Google Translate books.
- Dig up information through the Wayback machine to access a passcode.
- Use computers to crunch numbers.
- Send a small amount of crypto to a wallet in exchange for information.
- Talk to a chatbot to change the features of the escape room.
- Send an email to our escape room captor.

This is starting to sound less and less like a real escape room, but I think you get the idea. I believe that it'll be really cool if the internet was a tool that can help us escape. I think puzzles like this would be appealing because I don't think there has been a game where you depended on your internet skills to win. I hope you enjoy your week!
