# Algorithmically Adding Music to Live Broadcasts

A villain walking down a corridor without their evil theme song is just a dufus in a dumb cape.

That's because music is the lifeblood of our favourite productions. And it's a shame to see it missing from Opera interviews, Superbowls, and other live streams.

So the idea for this week is a program that can algorithmically add music to live broadcasts.

But we can't just add music at random. It has to follow the narrative and enhance what the speaker says.

Since the past and future context affect how sentences are said, the algorithm needs to look into the future to evaluate how music can be attached. That is why this algorithm should take advantage of stream delay to understand the context in the future before adding on the music and broadcasting the stream.

For example, if a soccer player lines up and hits the goal of the season, the algorithm should understand what happened and retroactively insert violins in anticipation of the season-winning kick. This way, the broadcast is dramatized when it's sent over the wire 10 seconds later.

Here's another thought. If we can intelligently add sound in, can we intelligently remove sound?

- Insert dramatic pauses.
- Filter out profanity.
- Redact private information.

If such a program exists, can YouTubers use this to help edit videos? Can such a program create entire compositions for blockbuster movies?

Anyway, I'm so glad that exams are over. If we haven't talked in a while, I'm super free for a call and I hope that you all enjoy your break!
