# Prompts to Help Creatives Think

It's fairly known that being creative requires a steady dedication to produce many works. For me, this involves thinking about questions I come into contact with and trying to turn them into sleepovers.

Here are some thoughts that I usually have in mind:

- When did Eren Yeager become so likable?
- What tools do internet historians lack?
- What makes me impatient sometimes?
- Can I turn this into a joke?
- Why am I having such a hard time searching for this file?
- Why do I spend so much time obsessing over films?

These newsletters are hard to make because I don't spend enough time reflecting on these questions.

That's why the idea for this week is a display to show you questions to think about.

Here are some locations I thought of to put these questions:

- On an Arduino display in front of my toilet.
- On a widget on my phone.
- On the landing page of my website blocker when I head to YouTube.com.

We should place these questions in spots that passively captures your attention. After all, that's when we have time to think. If you're staring at your phone, then you must be bored!

Moreover, since we arrive at these locations at different times of the day, these displays can help us approach our thoughts from new angles.

As a tool, these prompts would be handy for creatives because they naturally incorporate inspiration into their environment.

Heck, product managers could also use this to spend more time thinking about decisions.

I hope to set up this infrastructure one day, and I'll tell you how I feel about this project. Until then, have a great week!
