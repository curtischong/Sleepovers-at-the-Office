# Addepar for Philanthropy

Morning everyone,

Addepar is a website that helps the wealthiest know where their investments are.

Why does Mark Zuckerberg use Addepar? They have pretty graphs, that's why.

Unfortunately, many altruistic endeavours lack pretty graphs.

Since there is no similar software for philanthropy, giving may not be as fun as it could be, and thus, less would be encouraged to give.

So if there was a website that shows the impact of your giving as effectively as Addapar, I believe that more people would be inclined to give.

A website that shows the impact of your giving would be more fun than Addapar because it can tell more than where your money is, it can show you:

- Your cumulative effect across multiple charities.
    - The supplies you provided.
    - The lives you've saved.
    - Estimates on the economic impact of your contribution.
- How others are giving away their money.
    - Knowing that you're working with a team of others is a massive vote of confidence.
- Personal thank-you's from people you've touched.

Have a great week!
