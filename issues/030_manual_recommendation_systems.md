# Manual Recommendation Systems

Morning everyone,

Recommendation systems are too generic. Some days I'm feeling tired or just a bit off. The recommendations don't adjust to your current experiencing self. That's the problem; our recommendations follow a global trend, but there's a large squared error between that and how we feel at the moment.

I believe that recommendation systems should account for your current feelings by:

- Considering your calendar.
- Considering your biometrics.
- Or by offering a few sliders/buttons to tweak their recommendations on the fly.

I know this is a stretch, but I hope to see Spotify allow us to save and upload our own recommendation systems one day. I think that'll be really fun (and it'll also make for a perfect birthday present).

I hope you have a great week.
