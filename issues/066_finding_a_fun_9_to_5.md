# Finding a Fun 9 to 5

###### First posted on August 16, 2021

I find that the team you're working for has a larger impact on your happiness than the company you're working at. Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to know what we're signing up for until we're at the job.

Especially since vesting periods are 1+ years long, most job seekers don't get much practice searching for jobs. With such long iteration times, it's difficult for people to acquire a strong intuition for how fun their job will be.

Here are some ideas I've had to gauge how fun it is to work for a team:

1. You can work as a contractor for a month before fully committing.

   - Startups do this to see if new hires are compatible.

2. Once you've received a job offer, employers should send you screenshots of typical PRs you'll be writing/reviewing.

   - You can see how the team communicates.
   - You can get a sneak peek of the code quality.

3. Try asking for access to a technical design doc before you start.

   - You can see the types of decisions people make when they're at the job.
     - What level of mental stimulation does this job require?
   - You'll be able to see the kinds of constraints the team is working under (and evaluate if you're comfortable working under those constraints).
   - You can also gauge how fast the team moves by looking at this doc.
   - This document can also indicate what to learn before you start your job.

4. Probe into the company's iteration time (cause shipping quickly is fun).

   - Are tests run on a physical machine or in a simulator?
     - How many iterations of this device were tested?
   - How long does it take to run tests?
   - Which fire took the longest to debug? Why?
   - How long can PRs sit before they are reviewed?
     - Do you have to wait for people on the other side of the world to wake up?

There are a million other things you can ask for, but I think these four will give you the strongest sense of life at the company because you're glimpsing into the specific team's day-to-day operations.

Who knows? Maybe there is a market/incentive for job boards to integrate these asks into the hiring process to increase a company's retention rate.

Anyway, that's about it, so I wish you the best at finding your next job!
