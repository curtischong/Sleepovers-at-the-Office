# Tools to Undermine Biased Graphs

I never liked pie charts because it's hard to interpret proportions, especially when the pie slices are in different orientations.

A percentage bar graph is much better because you can see how many bars you need to stack up to reach another bar on the graph. This graph is easier to interpret. Moreover, the labels are aligned, which makes reading them more comfortable.

I wish there were a Chrome Extension that shows you a percentage bar graph just by hovering your mouse over a pie chart.

I'm also wary whenever I see a trend line on a graph since other trends can probably fit the data well.

So my second wish Mr. Genie, is for a Chrome extension that shows other trends that fit the same graphical data. There should also be other statistics, such as a 95% prediction interval and an R^2 value for a given trend.

These features are great applications for AR glasses because they allow you to see better graphs at all times.

Eventually, these glasses may also help underscore other types of bias by "unbreaking" broken line graphs or by converting data from log scales to linear scales. Yes, these graphs will be less meaningful, but I just want to see how the original data looks like!

Last but not least, my third wish is for you to have a great week :)
