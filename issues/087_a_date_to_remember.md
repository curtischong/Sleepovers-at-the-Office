# A Date to Remember

###### First posted on March 21, 2022

My plane lands, and it’s 5 am. I really need to sleep, but I’m a bit too happy to try.

I just came back from the best date of my life.

We all have unforgettable memories. For me, I try to remember them by collecting souvenir stickers, filming nerdy vlogs, and writing about them on Sleepovers.

But sometimes, I try to write a memoir of how I felt then. And my favourite parts of those memoirs are the quotes that snapshot what someone said at that moment.

These quotes bring those memories to life. It makes the difference between reminiscing and laughing like Marcel just whispered that joke.

So maybe we need Google Photos for quotes. Because sometimes, your internship passes too quickly, or a school term blurs all the months in between. So it’d be really nice if I could listen back to what Julian thought of the rain when it suddenly poured on our voting escapade.

Anyway, it’s getting late for me, so I wish you the most romantic of memories this week.
