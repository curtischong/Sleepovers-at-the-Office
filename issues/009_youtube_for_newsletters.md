# YouTube for Newsletters

Morning guys!

Newsletters are like bad breakups. Once your words are out, you'll spend hours worrying about what they think. There's certainly no conversation!

To garner reader opinions, newsletters should enlist these features:

Like buttons.
Comment threads.
With this data, writers can refine their issues and computers can even

Recommend issues personalized for you.
Introduce new authors.
In a nutshell, newsletters should adopt YouTube's most successful traits.

I hope you'll read a heartwarming story this week.
