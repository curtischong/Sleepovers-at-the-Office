# A Unit for Fun

###### First posted on June 25, 2022

How can you get someone else to understand how much fun you were feeling in the moment? I think we'll need a baseline metric to share how fun something is. But how can we make one?

You can't say something is as fun as watching two episodes of Friends because not everyone has seen that show. It's also pretty subjective.

Could you use a quantitative measurement like the amount of dopamine in your brain? Assuming we can easily measure dopamine (we can't), I think people's brains probably interpret the same dopamine levels differently.

Since your brain builds tolerances to other chemicals (such as melatonin), your experience of fun could vary between people even if you had the same dopamine readings.

I think a metric for fun needs to be in reference to the most joy you've ever experienced doing something. Everyone can remember the first time they put on a VR headset or went on the tallest rollercoaster. If we can compare experiences to the most fun we've ever had, I think that'd be a good universal baseline.

The only downside is that you're now framing everything relative to your highest highs. It sounds a bit negative if that musical we saw was 60% of the most fun I've ever had.

You definitely can't make this metric succeed, but it is a delightful problem to think about. I hope you enjoy your week!

P.S. I'd like to thank Maggie for talking with me about this Sleepover!
