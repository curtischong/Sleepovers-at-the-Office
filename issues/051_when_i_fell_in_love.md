# When I Fell in Love

It's 1 AM, and I'm singing old songs. And you know what? I don't want to write something serious.

So let's talk late into the night, like at an actual sleepover.
<br><br>
— A Lifetime Ago —
<br><br>
We met at a coffee shop.<br>
I smiled across the tabletop.
<br><br>
We were a team for the weekend.<br>
And I had my heart to spend.
<br><br>
So we packed up our bags and put on our tags.<br>
Got our laptops ready and kept our sleeping bags steady.
<br><br>
A border we crossed, and an hour we lost,<br>
A stop that cost, the winter frost.
<br><br>
Just a mile away.<br>
Just a mile away.
<br><br>
When we arrived, we strolled outside.<br>
We had no ideas, but that didn't matter.<br>
To code or to skate, I chose the latter.
<br><br>
So we hit the ice.<br>
You were was as swift as a dice.<br>
Always taking on chances.<br>
We wanted to go on an adventure.<br>
It was fearless.
<br><br>
I recall falling for you when I asked for your music.<br>
I found it nice and sweet, like the sound of punic.<br>
It reminds me of the literature you love.
<br><br>
At that moment, you've found your boy, and I've found my girl.
<br><br>
Though we had work to do, we ignored the cue.<br>
We got s'mores and ran outdoors.
<br><br>
I loved your time and hoped for more time.<br>
We played tennis, and it felt like Venice.
<br><br>
You were a personality, becoming my plurality<br>
You took away my mentality, normality, formality.<br>
Three days with you was centrality.
<br><br>
It was an excuse,<br>
But I wanted a hug.
<br><br>
A symbol of affection, exploration, and reflection.<br>
A rush of emotion, and I brewed hope potions.
<br><br>
Though we left without trophies to theft,<br>
we brought home a few moments to heft.
<br><br>
Our bus waited for takeoff.
<br><br>
Onboard I learned of your history.<br>
Both romanticy and mystery.
<br><br>
I remember lights dotted along the horizon.<br>
Every town we passed added to the collection.
<br><br>
But alas, the time has come, and the night succumbed.
<br><br>
A forest no more.<br>
Day breaks at the door.
<br><br>
We said our goodbyes under fluorescent skies.<br>
I'll treasure this moment, your forever eyes.
<br><br>

P.S. Most of this was written when we were still together. Of course, rhymes don't maintain relationships. So for those of you who know who this about, I don't feel this way at all :) I just wanted to write down how I felt way back when. I hope you enjoyed this, and if you want less serious stuff every now and then, please let me know!
