# Wikipediafying Books to Make Reading Fun

###### First posted on December 20, 2021

Has anyone else spent 4 hours clicking on links on your favourite fandom? Link-clicking makes reading fun because when you come across a new term, you get a “what’s that” moment that leaves you wondering. The addicting part comes when you click on the link to learn more.

If browsing wikis is so fun, why can’t we bring the same format to traditional books? What if we could make reading fun by digitizing books into their own Wikipedia pages?

We could! And here’s how we could do it:

1. Create a page for each topic in the book’s scope.
2. Bidirectionally link two pages if they are:
    - Related to each other.
    - Pre/post-requisite topics.

Here are the advantages it would have over traditional books:

1. If there is a term you don’t understand, you can click on the link and learn more.
    - This creates a “what’s that” moment that engages the reader.
    - The “what’s that” also motives why you’re learning that topic. Many authors aren’t good at explaining the motivation for learning a concept.
2. You can skip boring topics (since it’s all on one page).
    - It’s hard to gauge how far to “skip ahead” with traditional books.
3. You can choose how deep to dive into a topic before moving on.
4. You can fuzzy search for topics (each page is a search result).
5. The writing is sharper since authors need to be concise and break up individual subjects into new pages.
    - Fluff is contained into a single page and doesn’t drone on for chapters.
    - Shorter pages = more fun.
6. Authors can tell stories/introduce concepts in nonlinear formats.
    - Sometimes telling a linear story makes it more confusing.

Cool, but how would people “finish the book”? We could:

- Show the percentage of pages you’ve read.
- Highlight a list of pages you haven’t read, which are sorted by
    - The most popular (crowdsourced from other readers).
    - The pages that have the most adjacent edges to topics you’ve read.
        - These pages should be the most familiar since you've read most of the pre-requisite information to understand that page.
- Have a bookmark system for people to revisit pages they’re reading

I think this type of book could take off because it gamifies the exploration of topics that interest you. This is also better than Wikipedia because it’s written in the style of the author, and the topics you learn are contained to the book’s scope (you can’t accidentally read about the Spanish Inquisition when you started with pottery in the Middle East)

Whether it’s a show or a book, I hope you find a lovely story to binge this winter. I also hope you have a great week!
