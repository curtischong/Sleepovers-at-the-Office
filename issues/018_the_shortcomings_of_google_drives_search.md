#  The Shortcomings of Google Drive's Search

Morning everyone,

Gmail's search box has helped us find that heartwarming email that we haven't seen in years.

That's why sorting your email doesn't matter; email search is strong enough to find what you're looking for.

Google's search is phenomenal. However, Google Drive's search is quite rudimentary.

If you search for a term, it merely returns all documents with that term. Unlike emails, documents generally contain a lot more nuanced information.

Great search boxes should help you find:

- X Y and Z words that show up on the same line.
- Word X that appears before word Y.
- Topic X that appears before topic Y in the document.
- Terms that are semantically similar (sometimes you don't remember the exact word you're looking for).
- Conjunctions of multiple search rules.

Furthermore, incredible search should:

- Preview the document containing your search (more context around the search term's location is always good).
    - The amount of context should be limited so we can display more results per page.
    - Variable amounts of context would be the most exciting.
        - We can show more search results if some resultsÂ require less background.
- Search for:
    - Text in images.
    - Descriptions of images.
    - Words mentioned in videos.
- Identify the intent of your search.
    - To review notes.
    - To download a scan for a client.
    - To hunt inspiration and overcome writer's block.
    - To reminisce.
    - To append to a previous thought.
- Recommend other documents that are prerequisites to understanding the current documents.
    - E.g. To understand your notes on confidence intervals, you'll need to review your notes on standard error.
        - Perhaps we can have a Most Recently Accessed scoring system to predict your understanding of "standard error" before presenting the prerequisite documents.
- Include Roam Research-like link functionality that shows you results from similar searches.

Why does search need to evolve to such a complicated state?

Because I believe that for "the second brain" mantra to succeed, our search tools will need to be world-class. If I have to perform a binary search in Notion every time I jot down new rap verses, I'm not interacting with my second brain; I'm trying to find a folder quickly enough so that I don't forget my thoughts.

With perfect search, we can go a step further. We can fulfill the true premise of a second brain. Maybe we can insert all of our thoughts/facts into a text box, and then the software will suggest the top 3 locations to append your thought. This input box helps us focus on the idea instead of the file system storing our ideas.

Personal document search is an unsolved problem, and it's possibly even harder than an internet search. So we shouldn't be too hard on the Drive team because they probably have many infra fires to put out.

Get some great soul searching done this week!

## Author's Amendments

In the sorting chapter of Algorithms to Live By, they mention that a linear search
across your "most recently opened" file list is the fastest way to find the document you need.
It's even faster than traversing a file tree.

After writing this newsletter, I organized some files on my computer, which messed up my "recently used" list since I had to open files and assess if I should delete them. This caused a problem because it polluted my "recently used" list with random files.

So another way that Google Drive and macOS can improve search is to detect when you are organizing files and temporarily disable adding files to your most recent list.
