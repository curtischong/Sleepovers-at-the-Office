# I Think I Know Why I Like You

###### First posted on June 28, 2021

Today's newsletter was going to be about a program that detects if someone was lying on Zoom. The program would detect lies by reading nonverbal cues and would be touted as helpful in negotiation meetings.

In other words, it was going to be boring.

So instead, I want to share a theory about why I think people are attracted to others. A few weeks ago, I talked about the critical insight of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT):

Your thoughts create your feelings.

This means that if you are running alongside a road and cars keep honking at you. You can choose to think that:

1. They are loud and annoying douchebags or
2. that they are cheering you on.

This fact means that you can choose your feelings by selecting what to think.

I think this is why it's easier for me to develop crushes on others; I come up with a million reasons to like them, which creates the crush. But what if you don't know why you like that person? We can use a CBT technique called the "Downward Arrow Technique" to explain why.

The idea is to first come up with a vague thought that might explain your feelings. Then you ask:

1. Why would I like you if this thought were true?
2. What would it mean to me?

And you repeat until you dig deep enough to identify the belief that creates your feelings. Here's how a downward arrow might look like:

1. I like you because I enjoy your company.

   If this were true, it means that I look forward to seeing you.

2. I like you because I look forward to seeing you.

   If this were true, it means that I experience new adventures when I'm with you.

3. I like you because I experience new adventures when I'm with you.

   If this were true, it means that you've contributed a lot to my life.

4. I like you because you've contributed a lot to my life.

   If this were true, it means that you're one of the few people with which I can share anything.

5. I like you because I'm not afraid to share anything with you.

   If this were true, it means that you're always understanding.

6. I like you because you're always understanding.

It's okay if your answers aren't exact because it's often good enough if it's in the right ballpark. What matters is that you believe the final thought you arrive at. If you don't, then restart the process.

Here's another idea I had: If our thoughts create our feelings, can we implant thoughts into others to develop feelings for us? Are there a series of thoughts that you can give to people to get them to like you? It's like the movie Inception, and I think this concept has been extensively explored in the pickup artist community. And to be honest, I don't dare to study this, but it's an interesting question.

Of course, there are definitely biological factors at play. It's why actors are pretty. But since modern CBT is so effective at treating depression, I believe that your thoughts play a significant role in your romantic feelings.

So the next time you like someone new, maybe ask yourself: which thoughts are you telling yourself? Have you met someone else that incites similar thoughts? Maybe there are a series of thoughts that can predict whether you would fall for someone. Maybe we can predict divorce rates amongst couples who think certain thoughts about their partners. Maybe love is created by a flurry of smile-induced neurotransmitters and just a few adorning thoughts.

Ahhhh feelings are weird. I'm probably thinking too much about it. So I hope that you have a wonderful week.

P.S. It's obvious that I'm a CBT fangirl. It's probably because it has completely changed my perspective on why we have feelings. So if you have time, I'd recommend reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54930681-feeling-great">Feeling Great</a> by Dr. Burns (2020), especially if you're stuck in the blues.

P.P.S. Just putting this here for the record but obv another reason why I didn't want to do the Zoom lie detector is because it's a bit invasive of ppl's privacy.
