# My Personal Grammarly 

###### First posted on March 2, 2022

Every once in a while, I fall in love with a project that I really want to exist. So last year, I spent a month trying to write my own Grammarly editor. But instead of suggesting grammar corrections, this editor would help refine my writing.
As a proof of concept, I programmed it to:

<br>
1) Give my writing flare by suggesting idioms to use

</p>
<br>
2) Help me form similes by offering nouns to insert after adjectives.

</p>
<br>
3) Find-and-replace text that matches terms in my dictionary
<p align="center">

</p>

It was really fun, but like with all projects, life finds a way to enlist you into a school term.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I had a lot of fun working on this, even if I never used it. In a sense, this project is an artwork I admire, and I get really nostalgic whenever I turn it on.

Anyway, thank you so much for reading this and I hope you have a joyful week!
