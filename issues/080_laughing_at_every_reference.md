# Laughing at Every Reference

###### First posted on Jan 3, 2022

Have you ever heard a joke you didn't understand because you didn't get the reference? It sucks when it happens because it would've been hilarious if I'd just seen that ad or tweet.

What if every reference in a joke is one that we knew? Why can't punchlines swap out \<show we haven't seen\> with \<that moment from our favourite show\>?

Here's how it might work:

1. You play a Netflix special.
2. If a joke involves references to a TV show you haven't seen, the video will exchange that reference with one you understand.
    - The comedian could record variations of the joke that references different TV shows.
    - We can swap these references intelligently since Netflix knows which shows you've watched.

Since recording these variations is a lot of hassle, we could also "deepfake" the comedian saying each variation. Someday, each reference will become a fill-in-the-blank exercise for the comedian in post-production.

Expanding further, what might happen if this reference-swapping tech is used to:

- Build commonality in a sales pitch?
- Recruit different types of talent to a company? (by highlighting aspects that appeal to specific kinds of people)
- Optimize dating profiles? 

I'm not sure if optimizing every reference is a good use of time, but it is something to think about. I hope you have a lovely week!
