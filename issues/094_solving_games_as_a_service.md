# Solving Games as a Service

###### First posted on September 4, 2022

Everyone loves watching a close game. Because the suspense to see who wins kills us.

But when an athlete like Lewis Hamilton wins year after year with no clear contender, who cares about the winner anymore? The sport becomes boring without challengers.

That's why new strategies and techniques breed life into dull sports. When a player employs new strategies, there's competition for once, and suddenly, there's an underdog to root for. The game is fun again.

And what tools are great at finding new stretegies? Computers. 

Computers are great equalizers because they allow rising stars to study hidden strategies faster than the dominant player can. The arrival of computers led to better play, which led to closer games, which led to better games.

This scenario materialized in chess in the 2000s when computers taught players the best openings, which gave them better late games and helped them beat the old guard.

Aside from introducing strategies, computers also lowered the barrier to competitive play, spawning more competitors. When Lee Sedol lost against AlphaGo, intermediate Go players acquired a computer coach that was more affordable than hiring a private tutor. The frontrunners now faced stronger and more competition.

So in the future, I think game communities will fundraise money to train new AIs to make the matches more fun to watch. Players can start a Kickstarter campaign to pay companies to train and maintain AIs.

The games don't even need to be solved completely; any slight edge could help new stars compete and win the never-ending arms race to become better players.

I think this is all for the best. More people will have the opportunity for greatness, and spectators will not only see better games but can participate in real-time by analyzing decisions with AIs at home. 

That's all I have, so I hope you play some fun games this week!
