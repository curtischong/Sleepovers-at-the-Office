# Forgetting

Morning everyone,

This week's newsletter is about forgetting.

My friend recently had to delete many of their photos because of a harsh breakup.

I think that deleting their photos was quite healthy but an unfortunate decision at the same time. They will never relive those moments when they grow old.

Perhaps companies should start offering deletion periods. You forfeit all access to your data for the next x months. Only once your heart is well-mellowed can you view those photos again.

This idea doesn't have to be limited to photos; any service that acts as a time capsule for memories should consider adding features like this.

Sometimes you don't want to uncover last week's journal entry.

Other times, you'll text your Netflix account a farewell kiss until your exams are a trail in the dust.

Maybe those receipts are best left forgotten until April 29th (the day before your taxes are due).

For now, we'll have to live with these emotional burdens... or hammer these features out with Chrome extensions.

\- Curtis
