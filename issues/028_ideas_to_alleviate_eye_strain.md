# Ideas to Alleviate Eye Strain

Morning everyone,

These days my eyes hurt after a few hours on the computer, and the internet wasn't very helpful. So here is a list of things I've tried to mitigate the pain:

- Use a projector (my number 1 recommendation).
    - This uses reflected light, which is less intense than the light from a monitor.
        - This is why I only read on my Kindle.
    - Use a dark mode.
        - So the wall reflects less light.
        - Turn on the other lights in the room, so your eyes aren't straining on the text.
    - Use a bright projector.
        - The last thing you want is to strain your eyes even more by looking at the faint text.
- Use a large font.
- Use the right kind of glasses.
    - The wrong kind of glasses gave me headaches.
    - Use a pair of distance glasses for projector-viewing.
    - Use a pair of intermediate glasses when using a monitor.
        - NOTE: Ask for an intermediate prescription the next time you get your eye examined. My eye doctor didn't give me one, so I had to go back.
- Print and solve those damn proofs on paper.
- Turn f.lux on/off? (Until I experiment longer, this technique is just an epsilon to me).
    - I'm also not sure about using glasses that have a blue light filter.
- Wear sunglasses outdoors.

And here are some measures I've taken to reduce screen time:

- Turning off the screen when possible.
    - i.e. when watching videos/shows.
    - When calling friends.
- Looking away when I don't need to.
    - When I am typing long sentences (like this one!)
- Stepping away to grab water, to take vitamins, or to attend my hourly washroom appointment because I've grabbed too many glasses of water.
- Doing my thinking on paper, not on a screen.
- Not filling my time with my phone; I listen to music instead.
- Taking voice recordings instead of typing out notes on my phone.
    - This works best with late-night thoughts before sleep.

I also take longer breaks between computer sessions:

- Eating lunch without looking at a screen.
- Showering.
- Exercising.
    - Running helps me more than other forms of exercise.
- Eating dinner without looking at a screen.
- Flossing.
    - Finally, a perk to having permanent braces.
- Completing Chores.
- Laundry / cleanup.
- Reading.
    - I always have a light pointed at my Kindle at all times.

Things that didn't work well for me:

- Eyedrops.

Techniques I have high hopes for:

- Switching between a projector and a monitor.
    - This will give your eyes opportunities to look further away and closer up.
- 10-minute exercises every 1-2 hours (similar to the employees at Seiko).
- Looking at a distant object every so often.
- Using an e-ink display with intermediate glasses.
    - But they are quite expensive.
- Spending entire weekends without ever looking at a screen.
    - I think the absence of longer breaks is the root of my problem.

This was a lot, but I didn't find a comprehensive list online, so hopefully, this list can help you as well.
