# Verifying It's Me to the Government

###### First posted on Jan 17, 2022

Me: Holy crap. Thank you so much for answering. I've been trying to call for days.

Operator: You're welcome. I'm going to need some information to verify it's you. What's your \<phone number that you lost and forgot\>?

Me: ...

I never did find my phone number in time. So I wondered if there was a better way to authenticate people over the phone.
<br>
<br>
If I can log in to my online social security account, why can't the phone operator send a 2fa push notification onto my account? It would be much quicker to relay the 2fa numbers that popped up on my screen to verify that I have access.
<br>
<br>
I think this is more secure than verifying personal information over the phone because no sensitive information is transmitted over your insecure call, just a temporary 2fa number.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, since this account contains the most sensitive information, most people take more steps to protect it by using longer passwords and gating access to it with an authenticator app or a YubiKey (This OTP device significantly reduced account takeovers at Google).
<br>
<br>
Of course, not everyone may have the option to use this verification method, so existing authentication methods should still be in place, but I hope to see more banks and government services use this approach.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope you're doing well. If things are a bit lonely and you're looking for a friend to talk to, I am as well, and we should definitely take some time to chat. Have a lovely week!
