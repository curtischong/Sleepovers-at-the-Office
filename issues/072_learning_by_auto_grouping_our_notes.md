# Learning by Auto-grouping Our Notes

###### First posted on October 18, 2021

One of the best ways to study is to cluster what you've learned into groups. That's because it's easier for our brains to remember groups of information over individual facts. It's also why nonfiction books cluster their contents into sections and chapters. These sections improve our understanding by introducing similar ideas.

So if clustering information is so essential for learning, why don't we cluster when we learn in an informal setting? We learn how to code by frantically googling for the tools we need right now. We grind Leetcode without taking notes on the general techniques we used to solve it. And when we read papers, we forget to cluster our learnings with other papers that use the same methods.

I think this happens because it's hard to cluster your learning if you don't know what there is to learn.

What does this mean? I think it means that when we learn things informally, we forgetâ€”a lot.

We've all forgotten how to solve Leetcode problems months later.

So I think the solution is to cluster. And it's as simple as adding a tag to your notes for each topic.

And that's when it hit me. If clustering is so hard, why should we alone cluster everything we learn? Surely someone smarter than me has clustered what I'm trying to learn. Why can't we crowdsource the clusters that other people have found for this topic?

I think it would be valuable if my note-taking app could show the top 3 clusters that thousands of others have found for this topic. Because maybe it'll help me connect ideas and improve my understanding.

I hope you learn something you enjoy this week, and I'll see you next week!
