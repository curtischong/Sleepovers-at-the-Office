# Effortlessly Digitizing Notebooks

###### First posted on Jan 17, 2022

I've been writing a ton in my notebook lately because it feels more personal than writing on a computer. It's fun, but I always wish that I digitized it to protect me from Nestea accidents.

I thought about taking photos of my journal to OCR the text, but it doesn't feel fun. So I wish that there was a cap-like device that I could attach to the end of my pen to track my pen movements and digitize my journal.

I would probably have to write scripts to pipe the transcript into the appropriate diary entries, but that shouldn't be too much work.

But maybe the world doesn't need something like this. Many professionals (i.e. VCs / comics) see digitization as an opportunity to summarize and choose the essential parts of their entries.

Anyway, that's what I've been thinking this week. I hope you have a fantastic week. It's cold out, so dress warmly!
