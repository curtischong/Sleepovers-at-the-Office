# QR Codes for Robotic Construction

It's 2020, and buildings are still built by people. I think robots haven't taken over yet because it's hard to replicate human awareness.

Although I'm no robotics expert, I feel like QR codes can help with construction because it can solve the problems of (1) object identification and (2) self-localization.

1. If robots can identify objects in a construction site with a QR code, they can quickly identify which pieces they need next.
2. Since QR codes can locate where the robot is on the construction site, we don't need to install expensive transmitters to triangulate where the robot is. - An added benefit is that triangulation isn't that easy because signals can bounce off walls, making triangulation more difficult. - GPS signals bouncing off of skyscrapers is the reason why it sucks in some cities.
   However, there are some challenges to placing QR codes on every object. For one, we might not be able to print flat, square QR codes on everything.

Therefore, we need QR code formats for:

1. Round surfaces: i.e. pipes, supporting columns.
2. non-square surfaces (that do not have enough space to fit a square QR code).

Even if QR codes don't end up being used by robots, they might help workers with Hololens identify existing infrastructure components to help with remodelling.

I hope you have a great week!
