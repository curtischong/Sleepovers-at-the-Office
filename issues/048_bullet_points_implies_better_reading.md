# Bullet Points â‡’ Better Reading

Morning all!

- The problem: Paragraphs are lengthy
- Idea: Use bullet points to compress information
- Why?
  - Bullets are succinct
    - Leads to faster parsing
  - Tabbed bullet points retain information hierarchy
    - Like Reddit
  - We think in bullet points, not sentences
    - It's why Roam Research uses bullets
- Piggyback Idea: A Chrome extension that converts web pages into bullet points
  - Additional features:
    - Cluster sections under a table of contents (with links):
      - Introduction
      - Evidence
      - Analysis
      - Conclusion
    - Collapsable bullet points that hide information you're not looking for
  - Possible problems
    - How to showcase images
      - Maybe solved with images that appear on hover
        - Like links on Wikipedia
    - Not all pages work well in bullet point form
      - Like Genius
      - We need an option to disable bulletpointification for those websites
- Where I see the most use for this technology
  - The bullitification of non-fiction books
    - Cause authors like fluff
    - lol everything I read will turn into a paper now
- Problems with this idea
  - Connected sentences might make ideas more memorable
  - Speed readers may be affected
  - Life isn't about getting through it as fast as possible
    - Bulletification removes the humanity from writing

So that's why I wish for you to have a week full of wonder, a wonderful week.
