# Singable Songs

###### First posted on March 28, 2022

It's 2 am, and I can't sleep cause the other room's throwing a party. So I try to drown out their music by playing white noise.

No, that isn't working, so I'm going to throw on my favourite song this year, Tomorrow Tonight by Loote.

You know what? I don't feel like sleeping right now.

Have you ever noticed that it's hard to sing to newer songs? Either the lyrics are too challenging to sing, or not enough people know the song. And so, I find that the most singable are ones from the late 2000s/early 2010s.

I think it's harder to find songs that everyone knows because we no longer discover songs from radio stations. Perhaps it's because harder-to-sing songs pair better with more things on the internet. So they're played more often and become popular.

I don't know. Maybe if I want to sing more songs with friends, I should write a program that:

1. Finds the largest subset of songs we've all listened to recently.
2.  Sort this subset of songs by singability.

It'd be nice if a restaurant or a bar could play this subset when my group sits down. Or maybe I should learn to create singable music and hope it becomes popular.

Anyway, I hope you work on what you love this week. That's what makes you beautiful, right?
