# Pop Quizzes to Learn From Books

Recently I've been reading more self-help and psychology-related books. Although I have enough energy to read the books, I don't have enough to take what I've read to heart and change my behaviour.

So I decided to tackle this problem like a school course. One of the best ways to learn is to actively recall information over intermittent periods, i.e. by taking quizzes.

The idea for this week is to quiz you on concepts discussed in a book to help you remember what you've read. As an example, I've formulated some quiz questions for How to Win Friends and Influence People:

Q: What happens 9 times out of 10 when you engage in an argument?
- A: The contestants leave more firm that they are right.

Q: How did Walt Disney maintain his open-door policy when his assistants said, "he was busy"?
- A: He got rid of the door!

Finding a natural location to put these quizzes is the challenging part.

Nobody likes extra work, but I believe that reviewing your books with quizzes is one of the best ways to learn.

Have a great week!
