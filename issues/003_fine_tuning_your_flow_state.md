# Fine-tuning Your Flow State

Morning guys!

Today I want to talk about entering the flow state. [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm) is a lo-fi music streaming service that uses perfectly tuned beats and rhythms to hack you into intense concentration. To use the service you simply stream music from their website and start working.

I love the concept but I can't help but mull over how I would improve it:

- Make the service reactive. It should alter the music as it monitors your brainwaves.
  - Ex: If your brain activity is lacking Alpha waves then it should play rhythms that increase those waves.
  - A Muse headband should suffice (The headband is typically used for medication)
- Or better yet, tap into your Apple watch to do the fine-tuning
  - I think that you can predict someone's level of focus by using the accelerometer and heart rate sensors.
  - Since millions of people own one this would be a better alternative to the Muse idea.

It's a great service but I couldn't bear missing my favourite Taylor Swift albums when working. The holy grail for me is an algorithm that that can can get you into the zone while introducing minimal alterations to your favourite songs.

Get tons of work done this week!
