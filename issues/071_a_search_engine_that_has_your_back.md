# A Search Engine That Has Your Back

###### First posted on October 11, 2021

If you Google depression, the first results are helplines and counselling ads. I think it's pretty wholesome. But if you search for "payday loans near me," Google won't hesitate to point you to the sharks.

Wouldn't it be better if your search engine actually had your back? Something to tell you what to look out for? Maybe instead of listing out that payday loan within a 5-minute walk, it could offer links to better lines of credit or counselling.

These search engines could also help you out with smaller things by informing you that:

- Free Audible trials automatically turn into paid subscriptions after a month.
- Apple's butterfly keyboard warranty also covers battery replacements for free.
- Tether doesn't have $1 in reserve for each Tether token (fraud).
- Storms will flood your beachfront property within three years.

I think that Google is too afraid to take a side and show these warnings and filter results. The technology to do this is here, but larger companies like to play things safe. And I think it's a shame because they have so much data about us. So why not use it to help others?

Perhaps this feature will first be built by a startup. You don't even need to change Google search itself. Instead, you can just overlay UI elements via a Chrome extension.

I want to end by saying that if the internet of the 2010s was about sharing your thoughts online, then I think that the internet of the 2020s+ will be about helping you make decisions. We can't always make informed decisions, so we buy rubbish products and vote after a 15-minute google.

I don't know. I wish I were more informed. The knowledge is out there, but I don't know when and where to look for it.

Anyway, thank you so much for reading this. I'll see you next week!
