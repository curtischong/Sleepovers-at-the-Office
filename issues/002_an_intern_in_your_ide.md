# An Intern in Your IDE

Happy Monday guys,

Anyone who's read a new codebase wishes that there were more comments. I think that developers don't write enough comments/documentation because their code isn't confusing to them.

The problem? People don't recognize when to write documentation.

The solution? An IDE extension that reminds you to write documentation when it thinks that the code you've written could be confusing.

It may ask you questions like:

- "What does a queue_consumer do?"
- For objects with similar names and fields - "How is a response_handler different from a reply_handler?"
- "Why are we using a Red-Black tree instead of a heap when we're only getting the maximum item?"
- "Who does "received" refer to? Object A or B?"

I hope you write delightful documentation this week :)

\- Curtis
