# Using Neural Nets to Assist Therapists

This fact forms the basis of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy:

Your thoughts create all of your feelings.

This means three things:

1. Your negative thoughts create depression.
2. Your positive thoughts create happiness.
3. If we change your thoughts, then we will change your feelings.
   - e.g. We can turn the first statement into the second.
     - If it rains, then I'll get soaked and be uncomfortable.
     - If it rains, then I can run longer and feel more refreshed.

It's as simple as that.

In Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), therapists will often pick from a suite of tools to challenge your negative thoughts and increase your belief in an alternative, positive thought. This gets you out of your slump.

Since everyone is different, every person needs a different set of tools to recover. So how do therapists know what are the right tools for you?

They don't. But they can guess.

But CBT therapists don't just guess randomly; they use a 2-minute survey to measure your depression. A key innovation of CBT is to measure your mood before and after each therapy session to see which tools work best for you.

For example, if your happiness score increases by 70% after a session, then we know which tools are working. We know which methods decrease your beliefs in your negative thoughts.

It's so interesting because CBT is just like any other science. You use measurements to know how you're improving.

I was thinking about measuring depression, and I got an idea. If we treat the negative thoughts that lead to the most depression first, then we may accelerate your recovery.

For example, let's assume you're depressed because your low grades make you think that:

1. You won't get into a good school.
2. You're a failure.
3. You won't find a job and will become homeless.

Then which negative thought should we tackle first? I think the right answer is to tackle the thoughts the patient wants to tackle AND the thoughts that create the most depression.

But how do we know which thoughts create the most depression? Well, we can take a database of negative thoughts and pair them up with actual therapy sessions to see which thoughts were tackled in each session. If you are 20% happier after overcoming a negative thought in a session, then we can say that the particular thought attributed to 20% to your depression.

By aggregating thousands of data points like this, we can train a neural network to take a negative thought as input and output a prediction for how much a negative thought affects your feelings.

Granted, I'm not a licensed therapist, BUT if a neural network helps us identify the most influential thoughts first, then it might help people recover faster and save lives.

The hardest part is gaining consent from patients to use their therapy sessions in the training data, but I hope that we can build this dataset over time.

Anyway, that's it for this week, and let me know what you think about CBT! I learned all of this from David Burn's [Feeling Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54930681-feeling-great) book, and I hope that this Sleepover helps you.

I also hope that you think and feel excellent this week.
