# Players Cause City-wide Blackout to Win a Battle - Chatting with Eve Online’s CEO

###### First posted on Nov 26, 2023

The most expensive battle cost players $378,012. Over those 14 hours, 8,800 players called in sick to work because their duty to their in-game country supersedes all other responsibilities. These gamers work 100-hour weeks: 40 to pay the bills and another 60 to the war happening in Eve. For many who play, this is not a game. It’s their identity.

So when I bumped into the game’s CEO, I had to ask:

What makes it so compelling? How did they create an environment where incredible social emergence and coordination have formed?

Two things:

1. They initialized the game’s world with resources distributed just like the resources on Earth.
    1. For thousands of years, humans have fought over resources on Earth, and the asymmetry of the terrain and resources resulted in the drama in our history
    2. This made "a problem in the game’s universe for players to solve”
2. “You want to give players the feeling of control. But never give it to them. The moment they have a button that gives them actual control, they press it and get bored”.
    1. You can never have complete control over another person
    2. Random number generators also give players this sense of wavering control

Me: “It was just this for 20 years?”

Hilmar: “Yes.”

Me: “Aside from the control aspect, what other thing makes players so compelled?”

Hilmar: “It’s just that. At the end of the day, everything goes back to feeling like they almost have control.”

Hilmar didn’t understand these axioms when he started, but he does now, so he's making a new game to perfect the core mechanics. I’ve been a fan (not a player) of Eve history for a few years now, so meeting the company's CEO was incredible. That’s all I wanted to share with you all! I hope you have a great week!
