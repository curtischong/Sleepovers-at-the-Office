# I Want to Send You a Gift, but I Don't Know Your Address

Gift giving is difficult because asking for someone's address ruins the surprise.

My friend Song recommended a smart solution to preserve the surprise. Two weeks before your birthday, Instagram would ask for permission to share your address with your close friends.

Of course, this address would need to be updated once in a while, but I think it could work.

My other friends David and Jessica had another idea that would keep the receiver's address private. After buying a gift on Amazon/Shopify, just send a link to your friend to enter their address. Your friend directly tells Amazon where to send the present, and they don't need to know what it is until they receive it.

If you work for any of these companies, it'd be cool if you could pass these ideas on to a project manager :)

I hope you have a fantastic stress-free week!
