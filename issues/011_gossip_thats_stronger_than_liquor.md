# Gossip That's Stronger than Liquor

It's 1800 and the season is rife<br>
The time for romantics and a Dickensian life.


Today is his first photo<br>
Have a view from the ch√¢teau
 

There are many secrets as you can see,<br>
and only limited seating for thee


Oh don't you fret for Curtis is lear<br>
planning a newsletter for yesteryear


I'm a photo in disguise,<br>
and what will you pay for my sight?


In terms of time and attention, you see,<br>
for thee has problems up their creak


Life is busy, and goals are dizzy<br>
who has time for another Blue-whaled freak?


The theme for this week is gossip<br>
And Ohhh My, we can't keep our ears off it


A yearning for more is what you seek,<br>
and a photograph a week leaves thee intrigued


They come in black and white,<br>
with no caption in sight


If you seek to learn more, you'll need to reply<br>
Not to me of course, you Shakespearean force


Reply to your photo and ask if there's snow<br>
Perhaps Christmas bears coal and trips to the grain dole


Photos hold dear, even for cold-hearted rears<br>


Your best bet is intrigue, for that is internal,<br>
not some slogan from annoying journals


Week after week, another photo mystique<br>
That's how you build an activist geek


\- Curtis
