# A DeLorean to Watch Old Shows on Release

The fastest way for me to lose several days of my life is to get hooked on a Netflix show.

Binge-watching sucks a bit because you miss out on the theory crafting for the more serious shows. It's fun to predict where the plot might head next.

So the idea for this week is a Chrome extension that only allows you to watch one episode per week. This prevents us from burning through seasons without stopping to appreciate the show.

In addition, the program should only allow you to see the Reddit posts (and discussion threads) that existed before the airing of the next episode (so you can compare your theories with others without spoilers).

This would also be a great tool to help limit the number of episodes you watch during exams.


Anyway, I hope that this extension revives the social aspect of shows that ended years ago. I want to feel like a part of those communities from the first seasons.

If you make this extension please let me know! I'd be happy to beta test it. That's about it, so I hope that you have a week that's as vibrant as spring.

P.S. If you live in the GTA (and are 18+) you can probably schedule your vaccinations rn.
