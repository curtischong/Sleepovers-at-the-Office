# Highlighting Quotes in Podcasts

Hello everyone,

Today I wanted to copy and paste a quote from a podcast into Notion. Think of Kindle's highlight feature but for podcasts.

Imagine a future where all you have to do is ask Siri to "quote the last three sentences" to put the quote into Notion. Siri would also include a link that opens the podcast to the quote's timestamp.

Since your hands are usually busy when you're listening to a podcast, I think that voice commands would facilitate the best user experience.

Man, I wish I could write a pull request and implement this change myself because I really want this feature. Maybe that's a problem for another sleepover... Until next week!
