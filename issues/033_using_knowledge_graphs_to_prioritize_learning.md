# Using Knowledge Graphs to Prioritize Learning
Waterloo's course rating website (UW Flow) is one of my favourite websites because it condenses course ratings, prerequisites, and subsequent courses into a single page.

I wish there were similar websites to help me find my next books to read because some books are best read when you've read another one. Since books are very long, having this requisite tree can help me prioritize which ones to read.

Looking beyond books, we can apply this idea to knowledge in general. If we distill all knowledge into a graph, where each concept is a node and edges represent dependent topics, we can see what we need to learn before learning other subjects. For example, this graph can show me how to make a crème brûlée when I can only scramble some eggs by outlining a path between the two nodes.

Since most of us learn from articles, we can base this dependency graph on top of articles instead of building this knowledge graph from books. For example, if we want to understand article A, we must read article B first. We will represent these articles as nodes on the knowledge graph.

I love this idea because we can visually pinpoint regions on the graph that we don't know anything about. This graph makes the unknown visual, so we can learn about subjects that we would've never sought out to learn. Additionally, we can visually see nodes that we'd like to know about and the path to get there. The journey is no longer abstract.

When we first google "how to learn x," we often find many lists blindly recommending a learning path. However, everyone has different preferences, and I believe that everyone shouldn't take the same path because various topics excite different people.

With a knowledge graph, we can visually see the different routes we can take to learn things. This can also help with self-esteem because there's no one path to compare yourself to, giving you more confidence in your identity and the routes that paved your journey.

I hope you'll find a resonating Ted Talk this week.

P.S. This didn't make it into the actual issue, but if we can see the paths of knowledge you took on this graph, can we numerically quantify someone's identity? Of course, this is just a thought experiment bc we can't possibly map out everything someone knows.

P.P.S. What I said above may not make sense even if we know everything that you know since we aren't accounting for how you act, and that's a large part of our identities.
