# Clicking 1-week Shipping Over 1-day Shipping

Sometimes the things we buy online don't have to arrive as soon as possible. For example, I wouldn't have minded if Sukoshi Mart sent my skincare items three days later because I still have some product left.

That's why I think that Shopify and Amazon should offer a "ship between 1-5 day button" for items that we don't need right away.

Aside from the usage argument, here are some possible benefits of clicking this option:

- Truck traffic may be dispersed, leading to less traffic at any moment.
  - E.g. If most orders occur on weekends, then fewer trucks will be driving on Monday.
- FedEx may pass on their shipping savings to you.
- Amazon workers may get time to pee (in an actual washroom).

Of course, I'll probably be clicking on 1-day shipping most of the time because I just want my things sooner. But it'd be nice to have this option.

I hope you have a great week!
