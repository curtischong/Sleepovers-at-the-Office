# Is Production on Fire? Help Your Interns Improve by Taking a Vacation

Nobody is born funny.

According to Scott Dikkers, the founding editor of The Onion, comedy is a skill like any other, and you can build talent through education and hard work.

What does that mean?

It means that you can learn how to be funny. Funny enough to net you a career.

So what makes something funny?

Surprise.

Something is funny when you read a joke and understand the "hidden meaning" behind it. You laugh when this meaning is revealed surprisingly. If you didn't "get" the joke, you missed the hidden meaning.

Here are some one-liner jokes from Scott's "How to Write funny" series:

- Today’s forecast: Rainy with a chance of nuclear fallout.
- Missed Connection: We locked eyes during office building fire m4w – 30.
- CDC recommends haphazardly splashing hands with water to make them feel clean.

Notice the surprise? The hidden meaning?

Comedians make these hidden meanings funny by adding 11 "funny filters" on top of them to mask the meaning. Once you see past these filters and decipher the meaning, the joke becomes funny.

Diving into every one of these filters will take too long, but if you're curious, they are:

1. Irony
2. Character
3. Shock
4. Hyperbole
5. Wordplay
6. Reference
7. Madcap
8. Parody
9. Analogy
10. Misplaced Focus
11. Metahumour

Now that comedy feels more concrete let's see how computers can help us write comedy.
Here's what I got:

- Comedy needs to be original for it to be surprising. We can use Google to find how frequently X and Y are mentioned on the internet to gauge surprise.
  - If these topics are rarely mentioned together, there's a good chance that we can create a joke using the Irony/Character/Reference funny filters.
  - Can we write a program to find topics that are surprising when mentioned together?
- Can we use computers to find topics to discuss from more than one angle?
  - Seeing these topics from another perspective can help us use the Misplaced Focus funny filter.
  - e.g. A Modest Proposal: The best way to solve the Irish potato famine is to eat the children.
- Given a piece of writing, can computers identify the voice of the writing?
  - If the voice fits a character archetype, we can use the Character funny filter to mask our hidden meaning.

There are a million more tools that we can write to help comedians become better writers. And if you choose to pursue such a project, don't forget to have some fun! You're literally making fun. I'll see you next week!

P.S. Scott Dikker's books are excellent. I learned so much about comedy and how to write it. You'll probably see a weekly joke in Sleepovers once I practice writing a bit more comedy :)

P.P.S. This newsletter sounds a lot like the book Player Piano. Although I haven't read the book, if a sci-fi dystopian where all human labour is automated sounds interesting, you have to pick it up.
