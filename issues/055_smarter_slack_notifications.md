# Smarter Slack Notifications

I feel a bit bad when I ask someone too many questions on Slack on the same day. Since every message triggers a notification, the person I'm speaking with might lose focus and spend 5-10 more minutes to ramp up into their flow state again.

I think there can be a middle ground here. Not every message needs to be disturbing, yet some messages should warrant a notification.

For example, I think that these kinds of messages should never trigger a notification:
- Messages with filler words: "thanks", "lol", "bye", "hahaha".
- Messages with acknowledgments: "got it," "I'll get right to it," "mhm."
- Messages that add minor details to the conversation "I'll also update yarn."

And these kinds of messages should ping a notification:
- Messages with a question.
    - Because unblocking others is more productive than unblocking yourself.
- Messages that contain Jira tasks that are due today.
- Messages with a threatening tone: "Everything is breaking!"

Here are some other heuristics that Slack might consider before sending a notification:
- The number of meetings the receiver has today.
- If the receiver is in a flow state (detected via a Muse headband).

Of course, these heuristics aren't perfect. Some questions aren't urgent at all. So what if Slack gave people the power to choose if a notification would go through.

For example, if your message sounds moderately urgent, Slack will ask if you want to notify the person you're talking to. This offers you a chance to ask the question and be considerate at the same time.

If you work at Slack, I would love it if you pitched this to a PM because I tend to send a many non-urgent messages. Anyway, I can't wait to hear about your first weeks at work, and I hope you have a wonderful week!
