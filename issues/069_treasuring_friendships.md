# Treasuring Friendships

###### First posted on September 13, 2021

I love it when whenever I catch up with someone. But it's always been too long when I do. It's hard! Since I want to spend more time with friends, I've been thinking about an app to remind myself to reach out and initiate these catchups.

The app works by recommending to see friends you haven't spoke with recently. To track the last time you talked with someone, the app can remember when you last messaged someone. We can also encourage meetups by resurfacing old group photos from your phone.

I want to end by sharing that this summer has taught me that you don't need an excuse to ask someone to talk/grab food. Since it's so easy to start chatting with someone, I sincerely think this app can exist and help us treasure our friendships. I'll see you next week!

P.S. If this idea's up your alley, we should team up for our Fourth Year Design Project :) I really love analyzing how people talk with each other, and it'll be a fun time.
