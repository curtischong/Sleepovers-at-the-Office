# My Failed Attempt at Finding Love

"Thank you so much for everything." It was my last day of work, and I finally had time to work on a project.

So I went on Github and called their API hundreds of times.

My goal was to find friends of my friends.

<hr>

Wait, let's back up.

Several years ago, I came across an article titled "Looking for the One: How I Went on 150 Dates in 4 Months". Armed with spreadsheets and his fleeting youth, the author crammed a lifetime's worth of dates into 150 coffees.
<br>
<br>
Well did it work?
<br>
<br>
He failed.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps OkCupid wasn't optimal. He definitely had bad luck.
<br>
<br>
If he were to do it again, he said he would date second-degree connections.
<br>

<hr>

"Click." I've found 659 friends of friends on Github. I went through each profile the next day.

<br>
One.

<br>
<br>
There was only one person I really wanted to meet over Starbucks.
<br>
<br>
But what do I say?
<br>
<br>
It was a minefield of conversational pitfalls. I didn't think that I could say hi to a complete stranger. Asking someone out is the scariest thing in the world.

What if it means that we would never talk again? I wanted to meet them because I think we'd have great conversations. I didn't want that possibility to be gone.

So I did nothing. We probably could've hit off to a great talk though.

Fast forward to now, and I'm writing this newsletter. The situations are entirely different, but the feelings are the same.

I hope this time I'll actually say hi. Oh wait, maybe I already did. Until next week,

\- Curtis
