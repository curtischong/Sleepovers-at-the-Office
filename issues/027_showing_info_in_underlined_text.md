# Showing Info in Underlined Text

Morning everyone!

I'm working on Grammarly 2.0 (public alpha coming soon!), and I thought of a neat way to store information within a sentence of text.

Here is how Grammarly and Word show information in text:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/027_showing_info_in_underlined_text/normal_underline.jpg" alt="Underlined text"/>
</p>

The problem is that once you've underlined a piece of text, you don't have much room for more information.

Here is my solution:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/027_showing_info_in_underlined_text/standard_notif.jpg" alt="A text notif"/>
</p>


I call them notifs :) The coolest thing is the expressivity of the coloured dots. You can also switch up the order of the notifs to show more information.

 

Another way to express more information is by elongating the notifs. This can convey quantity (or morse code lol)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/027_showing_info_in_underlined_text/morse_notif.jpg" alt="A morse notif"/>
</p>

I'm really excited to show you my text editor. I'll see you next week!
