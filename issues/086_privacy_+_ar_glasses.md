# Privacy + AR Glasses

###### First posted on March 7, 2022

It's 1901, and I'm sending a letter to my sweetheart on the west coast. And I wouldn't know if she read it until she writes back a month later.

Isn't it weird how much communication has evolved? Who could predict that texting etiquette would be a thing?

I was wondering how communication would change if AR glasses appeared. Would we be our open selves, knowing that microphones are on each other's heads? Everything we say could be stored on a server (without any tonal/body language context).

What kind of conversations would we be comfortable having in groups? I wouldn't want to play the read receipt game when seeing a friend.

Perhaps we can ditch the mics altogether, but I think that's unlikely, considering how popular ml speech research is.

I feel that the best way to protect people's privacy is if the mics on our glasses could only hear what the wearer is saying. Perhaps it could use jaw vibrations or ear canal-based mics (like the ones used by noise-cancelling earbuds) to isolate and identify our speech, but not the speech of those around us.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing how the next iPhone changes our behaviour. Until then, this is all I have, so I wish you a lovely week.
