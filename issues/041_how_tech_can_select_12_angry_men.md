# How Tech can Select 12 Angry Men

"Alright, I'm out!". That was the last I heard from my manager since the start of the week. He was selected for jury duty.

Except, he didn't make it past the selection process. He was rejected after three days and didn't even hear the crime!

Wait, how are juries even selected?

They're not selected; they're rejected, typically based on their biases. Courts find these biases by asking many questions.

That got me thinking: Why can't we reject jurors from our online data?

We should use our data from:

- Banks to see our recent socio-economic status.
  - Did you recently take out a loan? Go on vacation?
- Google/Facebook to identify a juror's core beliefs.
- Google/Facebook to identify videos/articles they've seen.
  - You might not want to be on a case with an athlete if you spent last week watching sports documentaries.

This data can help us reject candidates before they even step foot into the courthouse.

What's even more fascinating is that we can use this data to identify biases that affect us in the near-term. You shouldn't serve on a jury if you're Googling: "What will make her accept my apology?"

Tech companies can also help mitigate bias after the jury has been selected. During the trial, members should be put on an informational diet so they cannot:

1. Read anything about the case.
2. Watch anything that can introduce bias.

I know there are some glaring privacy issues with this idea, which is why this should be an opt-in system. Furthermore, we should delete this data after the jury is selected.

I can also see many potentials for abuse, but I think it'll be in use a hundred years from now.

Until next week!

P.S. I just finished The Catcher in the Rye, and it's phenomenal. You have to read this if you love character-driven stories.
