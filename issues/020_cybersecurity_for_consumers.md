# Cybersecurity for Consumers

Morning everyone!


I have a secret secondary email that I use to sign up for financial services. If my main email is compromised, then at least I won't lose all of my BTC.


Another form of precaution I take is to opt-out of SMS-based 2FA in favour of physical 2FA keys. This prevents other people from routing your phone number to their SIM card, which allows them to steal password reset codes texted to your phone number. (This is called SIM-Jacking)


If the service only provides SMS-based 2FA, I would use my Google voice account as my phone number to prevent people from stealing my phone number.


I know somebody who lost a hundred thousand dollars for not doing this.


I'd love to see a one-size-fits-all security service for consumers. A startup that manages all of your:

- Hardware crypto wallets.
- Hardware 2FA keys.
- 2FA services.
- Alternative email addresses.
- Pager-Duty-like amber alerts when suspicious activity is detected on your email account.
- Virtual sim cards.
- Password reset receipt emails.
    - If an attacker changes your password, this service will make it so that they can't delete that receipt email.
    - Permanent emails help you to notice that something's fishy.
    - It also gives you more information to help customer support.

But no startup has a long enough runway to educate a target market large enough to want these services. Unfortunately, I feel that this security vaccine will only become mainstream when large companies start pouring in the market education costs.


Anyway, I hope you'll spend more time thinking about security this week!
