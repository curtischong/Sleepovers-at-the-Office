# Sharing Opinions with Formulas
Gloves!

Which qualities make a great glove? Here's how I would score gloves:

```GloveGreatness = 3.2*whiteness - 2*mass + 0.3*coversFingers```

You can tell that I love the colour white more than any other quality.


I wish that there was a website where I can share formulas with the world. It's Stack Overflow, but the answers are formulas.
 

What makes excellent writing? What are the five worst dysfunctions of a team? What makes you fulfilled?
 

I love this idea because algorithms can tell you a lot about someone's values.
 

This website also helps people solidify their thoughts by translating their emotions into a specific formula. The process of writing empowers people to reconsider opinions and take a step closer to the truth.
 

If you hate writing, this is the app for you. I say vote with your equations, not your emotions.
 

Here are more features I'd want the site to have:
- Show what the average formula would look like.
  - This tells what a typical person thinks of a topic.
  - For questions with divided opinions, the site should show one average formula for each viewpoint.
- Sliders to see how changing one parameter changes the result.
- The ability to design equations that use probability distributions.
  - Ex: `GloveGreatness = 2*N(0,1)*mass + 4*whiteness`
- Line graphs plotting how each variable affects the outcome.
- Comments so you can disprove someone's algorithm with sets of parameters that serve as counterexamples.

P.S. I love how there are formulas to determine "whiteness": [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference)

P.P.S. coversFingers is a boolean value. We'll add 0.3 to the score if the glove covers your fingers.
