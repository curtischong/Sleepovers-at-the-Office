# Is ___ Funny?

###### First posted on Feb 7, 2022

I want to be a comedian when I grow up, so I’m trying to write many jokes. But it’s hard! It’s a bit demotivating because I don’t have a concrete metric to measure if I’m getting better or not.

So I was thinking of ways to measure how funny my jokes are. I could:

1. Tell the joke in front of friends and measure how loud they laugh (in decibels).
2. Measure how loud I laughed when I first thought of the joke.
    - Since jokes get boring the more you work with it
3. Outsource people to score jokes on a scale of:
    - (0) not funny
    - (1) almost funny
    - (2) funny
    - (3) hilarious
4. Create an algorithm factoring comedic laws:
    - The number of syllables in the joke
    - If it avoids cliches
    - How close to the end is the punchline
    - If it targets the comfortable rather than the afflicted
    - The number of funny filters it uses (more = funnier):
        - Irony
        - Character
        - Reference
        - Shock
        - Hyperbole
        - Parody
        - Wordplay
        - Analogy
        - Madcap
        - Meta humour
        - Misplaced Focus
    - etc.

I think the simplest way is to put my writing out there and see if it gains traction, but I’m too scared to do that yet.

I guess the main reason why I want to create a quantitative metric is that I want to build a deterministic long-term system to write jokes. And this metric will help guide me to make such a system, just like how Google uses a metric to determine how good their search results are.

Anyway, the path for me to improve is to put in the hours, so I promise to make you laugh next week. Until then, I hope you have a great week.
