# Your AC Works Too Hard

Morning all!

Rooftops in hotter climates are coloured white to reflect heat.

As you may guess, Canadian roofs are dark to keep us warm in the cold winter.

But for the spring and summer months, our dark rooftops excessively heat our homes, making our second floors uninhabitable without fans and expensive electricity bills.

But when temperatures are consistently 35Â°C in the summer, our roofs shouldn't be black; they should be white!

So the idea for this week is a roof tile that changes colour based on the temperature. That way, our homes will be cooled in the summer and warmed in the winter.

Indoor cooling is taxing on both your wallet and the environment. That's why I think that adaptive roofs can make a substantial dent in curbing GHG emissions. It just makes sense.


Get some fresh air on a morning run this week!

P.S. I wasn't going to release this idea because it didn't feel relevant to this newsletter's theme. This all changed after hearing about TED's Countdown Project (to cut global emissions in half by 2030). We gotta start somewhere.
