# Spreadsheeting Friendships

###### First posted on May 2, 2022

I attended a "how to adult" talk last week, and I took away one thing:

You have to be deliberate with your friendships after university.

It's because when school ends, you no longer see people naturally over internships or school activities.

In the talk, the speaker developed a spreadsheet to track the last time she talked or met up with a friend. And she uses this spreadsheet to reach out to them when it's been too long. Another way she thought about friendships was to consider some of them as daily/weekly/monthly friends or as board game/vacation/confidant friends.

I thought that it was novel and courageous of them to share, so I wanted to mention it. I previously believed that you just needed an app to remind you to talk with people. But I missed the key idea: You have to be intentional with your friendships. And maybe putting it into a spreadsheet helps you define each friend's roles.

I don't know how my friendships will change when I toss the cap, but I do know one thing. I'll try to make an effort to keep in touch with everyone who reads sleepovers. I really appreciate it when you read this because you matter a lot. So I hope you have a great week.
