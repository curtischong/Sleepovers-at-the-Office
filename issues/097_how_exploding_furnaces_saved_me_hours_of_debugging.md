# How Exploding Furnaces Saved Me Hours of Debugging

###### First posted on Feb 14, 2023

For the last six months, Carlâ€™s furnaces kept exploding. He's been trying to make his furnaces indestructible, but in 1910, holding back 200 atmospheres of pressure in a furnace had never been done.


Carl's problem is that the high pressure caused the walls of his furnace to absorb hydrogen, making them brittle.


He's defeated. So on his only night off, he heads to the bowling alley and socializes with his team.


Eureka.

The following day, Carl drills holes into the walls of his furnace. Small enough to keep the pressure but large enough for hydrogen to leak out.

It works. And ammonia torrents from his furnace for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This one idea saved the world from running out of fertilizer. And it came to him after a night of bowling.

Like Carl, I've spent hours solving programming bugs yet making no progress. Only when I take a break do I get a novel insight or question my current approach.

Knowing when to stop and take a break could save more hours than using tools like Vim or GitHub CoPilot because it can help you get back on the right track.

So I wrote a Chrome Extension that analyzes your searches and tells you to take a break when it thinks that you're searching for a sterile solution. It warns you when you've searched for the same term too frequently, but it could be improved to only alert you when you've searched for similar queries recently.

Over time, I hope to improve the extension by:

- Asking you to explain the problem to help you realize the incorrect assumptions you made
- Actively search the internet for you to speed up your search
    - The sooner you know you're at a dead-end, the faster you can move on to other approaches
Overall, I feel that most programmers (myself included) focus too much on the tools they are using and need to spend more time sharpening their problem-solving approach. So I hope that meta-programming tools will become popular and save us all days of our lives.


I hope you all love what you do, and I wish you the best of weeks.

P.S. If you want to learn more about Carl's life, read The Alchemy of Air. It's a marvellous story about how two chemists developed a process that fed the world but also paved the technology that made the world wars much much deadlier.

P.P.S. If you want to try my extension, you can find it here ([github.com/curtischong/coder-reminder](https://github.com/curtischong/coder-reminder)). The code is horrible, and the timing of the notifications could be smarter. But I'd be down to accept PRs :)
