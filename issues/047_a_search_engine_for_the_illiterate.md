# A Search Engine for the Illiterate

40% of Canadians can't read well enough to do everyday tasks.

These tasks include:

- Reading labels on a medicine bottle.
- Discerning substances as a Janitor.
- Reading and understanding the facts in an article.

Yeah. 40%

Literacy levels are measured on a scale of 1-5. If you're at a level 1, you'll struggle with reading any text. If you're a 5, you can read dense materials that require specialized knowledge.

Being at a level 3 allows for success in society. Reading isn't a problem, and you can read between the lines.

And the 40% we talked about? That's level 2, these people are below a grade 5 reading level.

So forget about "learning x online" to expand your skillsets. If you have trouble reading, your opportunities are limited.

So here's a startup idea: A search engine for the illiterate. And here's how it might look like:

- People should search by talking to the search engine.
- Search results should have images next to them to help with understanding.
- Links should prioritize video media if relevant.
- Results should be heavily vetted for trustworthy sources.

But the search engine should also help people navigate webpages with:

- A support hotline for assistance.
- Algorithms to highlight important sections in the webpage.
- Algorithms to explain dense text with simple summaries.

If jobs are going to be automated away, then more jobs will require a higher literacy level. That's why we should consider expanding adult literacy programs or investing in assistive tools.

There's a cornucopia of literacy tools just waiting for VC funding. Since people don't think about this problem, I think there's tremendous room for opportunity. So tell me if you work on this! I want to hear what ideas you all come up with.

As always, have a great week.
