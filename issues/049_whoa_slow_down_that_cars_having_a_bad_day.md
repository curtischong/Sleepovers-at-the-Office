# Whoa, Slow Down. That Car's Having a Bad Day

Pro poker players use nonverbal communication or "tells" to determine if someone is lying.

Tells are quite easy to spot. For example, if someone has given up, they're probably seated deep in their chair. Or if someone frequently looks at their cards, you better watch out because they're making sure that their King didn't change into a 3.

Emotional drivers also have tells. They may:

Accelerate and break much harder.
Turn sharper.
Speed through lights and residential areas.
Tells are important because they help us navigate threats in conversations and dangerous activities like driving.

As of writing, automatic vehicles aren't safe enough to drive in municipal streets.

I think that factoring these emotional tells can help cars proactively detect threats and allocate safe buffer zones around emotional drivers. Only then will I step into a Tesla.

This begs the question, what else radiates tells? What tells do people often overlook? What tells do we take for granted? This is a personal opinion, but I think that math and engineering programs don't train students well enough to recognize these tells. So we write programs that don't factor them in.

Anyway, I hope you have a great week and drive safely!
