# Paying $0 to $10 a Month for Netflix

###### First posted on August 23, 2021

Streaming services are expensive. If you have Apple TV, Netflix, HBO Max, and Disney+ simultaneously, that's $40 a month! But what if you're binging three shows on Netflix, then you're burning $30 paying for the other services that month.

That's why I think that streaming services should meter your usage, much like how utilities meter electricity. In this new subscription model, you would pay $0.35 per hour of watch time. To prevent users from overpaying, we should cap their subscriptions to $10 a month. If every streaming service prices this way, your monthly TV bill will range from $0 to $40 a month. I love this payment scheme because it allows you to watch all shows on each platform at a price that adapts to your usage.

This can actually be really helpful for streaming services because it incentives people to play shows when they're focused, thus decreasing server loads. Metered subscriptions also help Netflix's data science team better understand user behaviour because the motivation to only watch shows you want to watch will de-noise their data.

This payment plan also reduces the friction for users to subscribe to newer streaming platforms such as Apple TV because there is less risk if you don't like their shows. Moreover, this subscription model can help them catch up and build their subscriber base.

But obviously, Netflix would rather have a guaranteed $10 subscription from every user. From a business perspective, their current pricing model makes revenue predictable, which is preferred.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy binging some shows before school starts. Have a great week!
