# Metrics for Novelty

Morning everyone,

"Veni Vini Vici," the "Battery of the Men Without Fear," and "No Child Left Behind" are some of my favourite slogans.

But what makes a slogan great? What makes a name original? Here is my take on what makes a name exceptional:

- Emotional weight
    - We will bury you! (mistranslated during the cold war)
- Linguistic flare
    - Veni Vini Vici isn't just cocky; it's catchy.
- Simplicity
    - Read my lips, no new taxes.
- Relevance
    - The Trojan Horse computer virus.
- The frequency of specific word combinations
    - Making Neural Nets Uncool Again (this is the slogan for Fast.ai).
        - You never hear "uncool" and "Neural Net" in the same sentence!

If we can measure the effectiveness of a name, we're not far from making 1000+ brainstorming sessions accessible to streamers or large organizations. Let the algorithm filter the top 20 names!

Another idea would be to use these metrics to generate a fantastic name. We can put a description into online name generation websites or GPT-3 then filter for the best results using our metric.

The best part is, we don't need to use all metrics at once to filter for the best possible name. We can choose the names we love most under a specific metric.

For example, If we need to market a vaccine to anti-vaxxers, then maybe we should switch out our naming strategy and only consider names under the "emotional" filter ("Pro-Plague" hits harder than Anti-Vax).


I hope that you discover brilliant names this week.

P.S. I found the name "Pro-Plague" on a YouTube comment, I don't deserve any credit.

P.P.S. I know that "plague" is an extremely inaccurate name to describe many diseases, but I think that being overly technical will weaken the delivery of the message.
