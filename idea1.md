Authors can take years to publish a novel.


In comparison, musicians can finish a song a day. I think their creative process is sped up because they record flashes of inspiration as .mp3 files on their phones. Later they'll go through their recordings and crown a new song with these snippets from their collection.

Can authors record ideas the same way musicians record snippets of songs to help them write novels faster? What if authors can semantically search for long-lost scenes drafted up in vivid memory dreamt up from 2008?

A tool that can search for scenes riddled with "deceptive betrayal" can help overcome the dreaded writer's block or even sparkle plot synergies never considered.

Yes, authors may end up with MORE fragmented ideas if they mash a dozen ideas into a collage. But I think that a brilliant conductor will know when to give their picturesque snippets a solo.


I hope you have great reads this week!
