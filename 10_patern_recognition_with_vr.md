# Pattern Recognition With VR

Morning guys!

Contemporary chess grandmasters use computers to study different starting positions before competing. This preparation helps them understand the best moves when they see the positions on the board.

However, in a podcast with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, one of the best players of all time, he mentions that preparing with a computer is precarious. In tournaments, he would have trouble recognizing the positions he'd seen on the computer because the variations he studied were on a 2D screen, not on a chessboard.

As Maxime puts it, "you'll feel a bit uncomfortable [...], and every [momentary lapse in] attention could cost you the game". I believe that replicating the chessboard in virtual reality can enhance a player's pattern recognition.

VR headsets can simulate an entire chessboard and overlay computer-suggested moves, eliminating the disconnect between a screen and the board. In all, this technology would promote a player's pattern recognition since they would be training in an environment that resembles a chessboard.

I hope you'll study well this week!
